# Find Playlist duration

The program would first ask you for an API key,
IF you donot have an API key,I highly recomment to watch this: http://tinyurl.com/yyyuyg5z, as it shows you how to make one for yourself.

Then progam would ask you for the playlist URL,
which is situated at the top of the web page, like an playlist URL could look like this: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU


**If the API key or the playlist URL isn't valid then the program wouldn't work**
